# SNAC (Serial Native Accessory Converter)

The User port of the MiSTer offers 7 data lines to use for the core.
The serial port of the CD-i - at the front or back - makes use of 8 pins.
6 of those are data lines. Together with one line for the infrared signal
for the remote controller, this seems to be a match.

Since every CD-i has different types of ports, we rely on the common denominator.
Two SNAC modes are offered.

The **RS232 Mode** simulates a back port of a 210/05. It is connected to the UART of the SCC68070.

The **Dual Input Mode** simulates the front port of a CD-i that supports the official input port splitter.

* Without a splitter, it can take one pointing device which is connected to the SLAVE.
* With the splitter, the second device is connected to the SCC68070
