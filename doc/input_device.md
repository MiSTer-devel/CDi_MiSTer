Communication starts with device sending 0b11001010 to CD-i player.

Afterwards a frame of 3 is transmitted

    Idle state:
    0= 0b11000000
    1= 0b10000000
    2= 0b10000000

## Data format

This means:

The right button is B2.
The left button is B1.

The speed increments over time
It starts with 2 and changes to 8.
The relativ coordinates are two's complement.

Pressing left is negative X.
Pressing right is positive X.
Pressing up is negative Y.
Pressing down is positve Y.

When the D-Pad is pressed, the Spoon will send permanently. Button presses cause transmission only on event.
